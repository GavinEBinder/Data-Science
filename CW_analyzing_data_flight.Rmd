```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```


The `nycflights13` packages contains several dataframes that can be used together"

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/245292d1ea724f6c3fd8a92063dcd7bfb9758d02/5751b/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)

Check the number of rows/columns in the `flights` dataframe
```{r}
flights
```

Inspect the column names
```{r}
colnames(flights)
```

Look at the data frame in the RStudio Viewer
```{r}
view(airports)
```


1. Which airline has the highest number of delayed departures?

Identify the airline (`carrier`) that has the highest number of delayed flights

```{r}
has_most_delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  filter(dep_delay > 0) %>%
  summarize(num_delay = n()) %>%
  filter(num_delay == max(num_delay)) %>%
  select(carrier)
  
  
```


Instead of the airline code, now getting the airline name:

Get name of the most delayed carrier (use `left_join()` with the `airlines` data frame to get the name of the airline)

```{r}
most_delayed_name <- has_most_delays %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(name)
print(most_delayed_name$name)
  
  
```


2. On average, to which airport do flights arrive most early?

Calculate the average arrival delay (`arr_delay`) for each destination (`dest`):

```{r}
most_early <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay))
  
```

Compute the average delay by destination airport, omitting NA results

```{r}
most_early <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  
```

Identify the destination where flights, on average, arrive most early (use a `left_join()` with the the `airports` dataframe to identify the name of the destination)

```{r}
most_early <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(delay == min(delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(dest, delay) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  select(dest, name, delay)

print(most_early)
  
  
```


3. In which month do flights tend to have the longest delays?

Identify the month in which flights tend to have the longest delays
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(delay == max(delay)) %>%
  select(month) %>%
  print()
```

Compute delay by month, adding month names for visual display

```{r}
delay_by_month <- flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(delay) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name)
```

4. Create a relevant plot using the `ggplot2` package (for example, show the average delay, in minutes, by month)

```{r}
ggplot(data = delay_by_month) +
  geom_point(aes(x = delay, y = month), color = "blue", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Average delay by month", x = "Delay (in minutes)", y = "") +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(month.name)) +
  xlim(c(-20, 20)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, size = 0.25)
```
