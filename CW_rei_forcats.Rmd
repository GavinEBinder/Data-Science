Load the required packages 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We will use the [package `forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) which provides tools for dealing with **cat**egorical variables (and it's an anagram of factors!).

```{r}
library(forcats)
```


## Factors and Levels


Factors are how categorical information gets stored in R. Remember that _categorical variables_ are a type of variable that take on a _name or label_. For example: countries, colors, car makes, a [likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale).


Factors often look like _strings_, but behave more like numbers. This is because R is storing each level within a factor as an integer. R assigns integers to each level using alphabetical order.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

### General Social Survey

A sample of categorical variables from the General Social survey is included in the `gss_cat` data frame included in `forcats`

```{r}
gss_cat
```


Notice: 

- `marital` is a **factor** within our dataset

- "Never married", "Divorced", and "Married" are all **levels** of the factor `marital`

If we use the `str()` function we can easily see the different levels of all the factors in our dataset

```{r}
str(gss_cat)
```

Notice that there are 6 factors in our dataset: 

factor      | description                 | levels
------------|-----------------------------|--------------
`marital`   | marital status              | 6
`race`      | race                        | 4      
`rincome`   | reported income             | 16
`partyid`   | party affiliation           | 10
`relig`     | religion                    | 16
`denom`     | denomination                | 30


We can also use the `count()` function:

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  count(race)
```

We can see this also by creating a bar plot:

```{r}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
  geom_bar()
```


## Modifying factor order

It is often useful to change the _order_ of the factor levels in a visualization. For example, imagine you want to explore the average number of hours spent watching TV per day across religions:

First create an object containing the summaries

```{r}
relig_summary <- gss_cat %>%
                  group_by(relig) %>%
                  summarise(
                            age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
                            tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
                            n = n()
                  )
```

and then use `ggplot` to create a visualization:

```{r}
ggplot(relig_summary, aes(tvhours, relig)) + 
  geom_point()
```


In this plot because there is no overall pattern. We can improve it by _reordering the levels_ of `relig` using `fct_reorder()`. 

`fct_reorder()` takes three arguments:

- `f`, the factor whose levels you want to modify.

- `x`, a numeric vector that you want to use to reorder the levels.

- Optionally, `fun`, a function that's used if there are multiple values of `x` for each value of `f`. The default value is `median`.

```{r}
ggplot(relig_summary, aes(tvhours, fct_reorder(relig, tvhours))) +
  geom_point()
```

What if we create a similar plot looking at how _average age_ varies across reported income level?


```{r}
rincome_summary <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(rincome) %>%
  summarise(
    age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )
  
ggplot(rincome_summary, aes(age, fct_reorder(rincome, age))) +
  geom_point()
  
```

Here, arbitrarily reordering the levels is not a good idea! That's because `rincome` already has a _principled order_ that we should not mess with. _Reserve `fct_reorder()` for factors whose levels are arbitrarily ordered._

However, it does make sense to pull "Not applicable" to the front with the other special levels. You can use `fct_relevel()`. It takes a factor, `f`, and then any number of levels that you want to move to the front of the line.

```{r}
ggplot(rincome_summary, aes(age, fct_relevel(rincome, "Not applicable"))) +
  geom_point()
```



## Modifying factor levels

More powerful than changing the orders of the levels is changing their values. This allows you to clarify labels for publication, and collapse levels for high-level displays. The most general and powerful tool is `fct_recode()`. It allows you to recode, or change, the value of each level. 

For example, take the `gss_cat$partyid`:

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  count(partyid)

```

The levels are terse and inconsistent. 

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat"
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
```

`fct_recode()` will leave levels that are not explicitly mentioned as is, and will warn you if you accidentally refer to a level that does not exist.

To combine groups, you can assign multiple old levels to the same new level:

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
    "Other"                 = "No answer",
    "Other"                 = "Don't know",
    "Other"                 = "Other party"
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
```



## Other Examples

Consider the `airquality` dataset that contains daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.


```{r}
glimpse(airquality)
```

Let us convert the variable `Month` to a factor

```{r}
airquality$Month <- factor(airquality$Month)
airquality$Month

```

and we can also rename the months using the `fct_recode()` function:

```{r}
airquality$Month <- fct_recode(airquality$Month, May = '5', June = '6', July = '7', Aug = '8', Sept = '9')
glimpse(airquality$Month)

```


We can see the distribution of `Temperature` in the different months

```{r}
ggplot(airquality, aes(Month, Temp)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Month)) +
  ggtitle(label = "Daily Temperatures Aggregated by Month")

```



Sometimes it is useful to _reorder_ the factor in a way that is useful for visualization. For this, we can use the `fct_reorder()` function.

For example, let us use the `mtcars` data set:

```{r}


```

First, make the variable `model` a factor:

```{r}


```

and create a scatterplot to see the `mpg` per `model`

```{r}


```

It is difficult to make comparisons when the data is scattered. But we can use the `fct_reorder()` function to clean it up.


```{r}

 
```


We can even use `geom_segment()` to create what is sometimes called a _lollipop chart_

```{r}


```
