# Motivation

We are interested in using visualization and data transformation tools to explore  data in a systematic way, a task that statisticians call _exploratory data analysis_, or EDA for short. 

- Generate questions about your data.

- Search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modelling your data.

- Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## EDA 

_EDA is an important part of any data analysis, even if the questions are handed to you on a platter, because you always need to investigate the quality of your data._


_"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise."_ - John Tukey


# Some Definitions

- A **variable** is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure.

- A **value** is the state of a variable when you measure it. 


- An **observation** is a _set of measurements_ made under similar conditions. An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable. 


- **Tabular data** is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. 


- Tabular data is **tidy** if each value is placed in its own "cell", each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row.


# Exploring Variation

- **Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement. Each of your measurements will include a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement. 


- _Categorical variables_ can also vary if you measure across different subjects (e.g. the eye colors of different people), or different times (e.g. the energy levels of an electron at different moments). 



- Every variable has its own _pattern of variation_, which can reveal interesting information. 



# Distributions of Categorical Variable 

A variable is **categorical** if it can only take one of a small set of values. To examine the distribution of a categorical variable, use a **bar chart**:


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut))
```


# Distributions of Categorical Variable

The height of the bars displays how many observations occurred with each `x` value. You can compute these values manually with `dplyr::count()`:


```{r}
diamonds %>%
  count(cut)
```


# Distributions of Continuous Variable 


A variable is **continuous** if it can take any of an _infinite set of ordered values_. To examine the distribution of a continuous variable, use a **histogram**: this divides the x-axis into _equally spaced bins_ and then uses the height of a bar to display the number of observations that fall in each bin. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```



# Typical values

- Which values are the _most common_? Why?

- Which values are _rare_? Why? Does that match your expectations?

- Can you see any _unusual patterns_? What might explain them?


- How are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?

- How are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?

- How can you explain or describe the _clusters_?

- Why might the _appearance_ of clusters be misleading?


# Missing values 

If you have encountered unusual values in your dataset, and simply want to move on to the rest of your analysis, the following are some options:


1. Drop the entire row with the strange values

2. Replace the unusual values with missing values. 



```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  mutate(y = ifelse(y< 3 | y >20, NA, y))
```



`ifelse()` has three arguments. The first argument test should be a logical vector. The result will contain the value of the second argument, `yes`, when test is `TRUE`, and the value of the third argument, `no`, when it is `FALSE`.



# Exploring Covariation

If variation describes the behavior within a variable, _covariation describes the behavior between variables_. 

**Covariation** is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. 

The best way to spot covariation is to visualize the relationship between two or more variables. 


How you do that should again depend on the type of variables involved.



# Continuous vs Categorical

A way to display the distribution of a continuous variable broken down by a categorical variable is the **boxplot**. Each boxplot consists of:


1. A box that stretches from the _25th percentile_ of the distribution to the _75th percentile_, a distance known as the interquartile range (IQR). In the middle of the box is a line that displays the _median_ 

2. Points that fall more than 1.5 times the IQR from either edge of the box. 

3. A line (or _whisker_) that extends from each end of the box and goes to the farthest non-outlier point in the distribution.



# Boxplots

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/EDA-boxplot.png")
```


# Boxplot Example 


Take the `class` variable in the `mpg` dataset. You might be interested to know how highway mileage varies across classes:


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```
A little bit of extra exploration:

```{r}
mpg %>%
  filter(class == "suv", hwy > 20)
```




# Categorical vs Categorical 


Count the number of observations for each combination. One way to do that is to rely on the built-in `geom_count()`


```{r}

```


# Continuous vs Continuous  

The covariation between two continuous variables can be explored drawing a _scatterplot_ with `geom_point()`. 


```{r}

```
