# Data Visualization



We will learn how to visualize data using the **`ggplot2`** package: one of the most elegant and most versatile systems for creating graphs.

`ggplot2` implements the **grammar of graphics**, a coherent system for describing and building graphs.

# `mpg` dataset


A **data frame** is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). `mpg` contains observations collected by the US Environment Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Print the `mpg` dataframe:

```{r}
print(mpg)
```


# Relationship of `displ` and `hwy`

Among the variables in `mpg` are:

- `displ`, a car's engine size, in liters.

- `hwy`, a car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). 


A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.




# A first plot


A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ,
                           y=hwy))
```

The plot shows a _negative relationship_ between engine size (`displ`) and fuel efficiency (`hwy`). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel.



# Deconstructing the plot


With `ggplot2`, you begin a plot with the function `ggplot()`. 

* `ggplot()` creates a _coordinate system_ that you can add _layers_ to. 

* The first argument of `ggplot()` is the _dataset_ to use in the graph. So `ggplot(data = mpg)` creates an empty graph.

* You complete your graph by adding one or more _layers_ to `ggplot()`. The function `geom_point()` adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a **scatterplot**.

# Mapping data to aesthetics


>  An **aesthetic** is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties.


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ,
                           y = hwy,
                           color = class))
```



# Grammar of Graphics

`ggplot2` implements the **grammar of graphics**, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. The code you write specifies the **connections** between the variables in your data, and the colors, points, and shapes you see on the screen.

- In `ggplot2`, these logical connections between your data and the plot elements are called _aesthetic mappings_ or just **aesthetics**.

- You begin every plot by telling the `ggplot()` function what your data is, and then how the variables in this data _logically map_ onto the plot's aesthetics. 


# geoms


Deciding what sort of plot we want, such as a scatterplot, a boxplot, or a bar chart, in `ggplot`, we call the overall type of plot a `geom`. 
Each `geom` has a function that creates it. 

- `geom_point()` makes scatterplots

- `geom_bar()` makes barplots

- `geom_boxplot()` makes boxplots

Combine these two pieces, the `ggplot()` object and the `geom`, by literally _adding them together_ in an expression, using the `"+"` symbol.



# Example: diamonds dataset



Let us explore a dataset called `diamonds` included in the `tidyverse`. (More than 50 thousand records are available)

```{r}
set.seed(217)
sample_n(diamonds, 300) 
```



# Price vs carat relationship

Ask for Dimensions of Diamonds:

```{r}
dim(diamonds)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

- `ggplot()` – function that creates the basic `ggplot` graph

- `data` - the data frame that you want to use 

- `aes()` – short for _aesthetic_, describes how your variables are graphed

- `geom` – the functions that tell `ggplot` how you want the data presented (scatter plot, histogram, etc.)



# Recap


The graph shows how diamond price changes due to carat.

Let's deconstruct this command:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 0.3)
```

- `ggplot()` – function that creates the basic `ggplot` graph

- `data` - the data frame that you want to use 

- `aes()` – short for _aesthetic_, describes how your variables are graphed

- `geom` – the functions that tell `ggplot` how you want the data presented (scatter plot, histogram, etc.)


# Adding aesthetics



```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, 
                 y = price,
                 color = cut))
```



> One _common problem_ when creating `ggplot2` graphics is to put the `+` in the _wrong place_: it has to come at the end of the line, _not_ the start.


```{r}

```

# Example: gapminder dataset


The `gapminder` package includes the `gapminder` dataframe, data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

> Source: http://www.gapminder.org/data/


# Quick look


Excerpt of the Gapminder data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country.


```{r}
gapminder  
```


# Mapping aesthetics vs setting them


Recall that an _aesthetic mapping_ specifies that a variable will be expressed by one of the available _visual elements_, such as size, or color, or shape, and so on. As we've seen, we map variables to aesthetics like this:



```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent))
```



### Color all points purple?


The code before _does not_ give a direct instruction like "color the points purple". Instead it says, "the property `color` will represent the variable `continent`", or "`color` will map `continent`".

If we want to turn all the points in the figure purple, _we do not do it through the mapping function_. Look at what happens when we try:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = "purple"))
```


### What went wrong? 


What has happened here? Why is there a legend saying "purple"?
The `aes()` function is for mappings only 

Do not use it to change properties to a particular value. If we want to _set a property_, we do it in the `geom_` we are using, and outside the `mapping = aes(...)` step.


```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp), 
             color = "purple")
```

HEX is usable

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp), 
             color = "#532d8e") +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita",
       y = "life expectancy",
       title = "Data from gapminder",
       subtitle = "Test using Florida Poly purple")
```
